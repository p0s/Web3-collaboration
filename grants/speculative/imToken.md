# imToken

## Project Description
Currently, imToken (see https://token.im/ ) is a multi-chain non-custodial mobile and hardware wallet for iOS & Android with DApp Browser and DEX, monthly used by currently 1Million MAU, and a peak of 8M MAU in 2018.

1) We intend to create support for governance, staking, token transfers and more Polkadot features in imToken.
We think, the Polkadot  ecosystem will benefit largely from onboarding the biggest user base of mobile crypto users existing today. imToken currently has 1M MAU and a user base of 10M.
We intend to support sending and receiving DOTs, create and backup accounts, using fingerprint/face-id, watch price, tx history, cross-chain communication and more.
Part of this will also be functions to delegate & stake DOTs and vote on referendums/proposals.
We also intend to support with documentation such as introduction video, website, blog post, help center articles.
We are interested in creating this mobile support especially because we have already experienced how important mobile support is for upcoming blockchain ecosystems, as we helped the early adopters of Ethereum.
We also know how popular the Polka ecosystem in China developed already, and are happy to support it with our huge Chinese user base.

2) We intend to build a parachain, focused on our users' needs.
We do see that building actual applications on Polkadot will benefit the ecosystem. Bringing the benefits of Polkadot to the existing imToken community, as we currently do with our DApp browsers for Ethereum and EOS applications
With the project we will leverage a parachain for popular use cases of imToken such as payments. For exactly these use cases we see a big fit in using a parachain which makes us very excited about exploring building on Polka.

3) We intend to create support for Polkadot substrate chains on the imKey hardware wallet (https://imkey.im/) which we see as an important part of end-user security.
Having the chain integrated into a hardware wallet that already supports different chains, helps to increase the popularity of Polkadot and supports the ecosystem.
